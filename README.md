# Iris-Species-Visualization-KNN

Iris Species Dataset is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature. 
I used Jupyter Notebook to visualize the dataset Using mostly Seaborn, Pandas and matplotlib.
Also used KNN to predict the class of the flower based on available attributes.
